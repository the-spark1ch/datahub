# DataHub
File web server in Python, built on Flask to work with files and share them on a single network.

There is no support for creating accounts, the server uses one account whose data you specify through the ```USERNAME``` and ```PASSWORD_HASH``` variables. Hash password.

The web server runs on an internal IP, which means you can connect from any device in your home network.
